# Sorting Algorithms

## Description

This project is a collection of sorting algorithms implemented from scratch in C++. We're also computing the necessary time to sort a doubly linked list of numbers with each algorithm.

The main goal of this project is to learn and understand the inner workings of sorting algorithms.

## Usage

To run the project, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your machine. Then you run something like:

```bash
g++ *.cpp utils/*.cpp -o output

```

This will compile the project and generate an executable file called `output`. To run the program, and save the output to a file, you can do:

```bash
./output > output.csv
```
